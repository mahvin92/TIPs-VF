# TIPs-VF
TIPs-VF (or the Translator-Interpreter Pre-seeding for Variable-length Fragments) is a member of the TIPs family of encoding schemes for augmented representation of genetic sequences in machine learning, specifically for genetic engineering and synthetic biology applications.

For more information about TIPs, please visit https://tips.logiacommunications.com/

## Computational environment
Note that the implementation of TIPs for machine learning studies was tested only on Google Colab, but we welcome any contributions and improvements for local implementation using the recent Python version.

## Installation
1. The TIPs-VF encoding scheme is a backend-hosted tool that requires no installation. TIPs-VF submission is available at https://tips.logiacommunications.com/submission
2. Google Colab comes pre-installed with many popular libraries. However, if required please install the following dependencies: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, umap-learn, seaborn, and TensorFlow. Use the command: !pip install <library_name>
